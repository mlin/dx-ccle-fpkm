# GeneTorrent Builder (DNAnexus Platform App)

Builds GeneTorrent from source

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
https://wiki.dnanexus.com/.
<!-- /dx-header -->

This is a helper applet to build a given version of the GeneTorrent executable
(from the original source package) within the DNAnexus execution environment.
It produces a binary package which is then placed into the resources of
ccle_fetcher. Thus, this applet should only be needed when a new version of
GeneTorrent comes out. See: https://cghub.ucsc.edu/software/downloads.html
