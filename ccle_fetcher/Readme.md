# CCLE Fetcher (DNAnexus Platform App)

Fetch CCLE BAM files from CGHub

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
https://wiki.dnanexus.com/.
<!-- /dx-header -->

This applet uses GeneTorrent to import publicly-available Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets from the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub). It's clever
enough not to re-download datasets that already reside in the current project
from a previous run.
